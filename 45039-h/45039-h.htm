<p class="ph3">SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</p>

<p>Aston-ishing!&mdash;The English
Cup, won by the Aston
Villa Football Club last year,
has been stolen. Between
boots and football a strong
affinity exists; and it appears
that a <i>cordonnier</i>, a member
of the club, obtained a loan of
the trophy, which he proudly
placed in his shop window.
On a pedestal, in the midst of
all sorts and conditions and
sizes of shoes, it stood in silvery
splendour&mdash;a sovereign,
as it were, o'er a kingdom of
soles&mdash;and was the gaping
admiration of the "idle progeny"
of the neighbourhood,
who, as is well known, evince
ever an absorbing interest in
all things appertaining to "the
rolling circle's speed." And
the knight of the Soccus and
Cothurnus, the adept constructor
of <span class="sc">Jessamy's</span> slipper
and <span class="sc">Giles's</span> "hobnailed," the
owner of the store, lulled himself
to sleep singing "Dear
little Boot-ercup, Sweet little
Footer-cup," and dreamed that
the goal of his ambition had
been reached, and that he had
received the appointment of
Soler and Heeler Extraordinary
to all the Football Clubs
of the United Kingdom. But,
alas! he awoke one morn to
find that a burglary had been
committed, and that the Cup
had vanished! "It would
appear," says the <i>Liverpool
Courier</i>, "that the thieves
<i>wanted the cup for the value
of its silver!</i>" Oh! impossible!
Gentlemen who thus
acquire valuable articles of
gold or silver do so not for the
coarse gratification of an <i>auri
sacra fames</i>, but rather for
the satisfaction of an artistic
craving, a laudable desire to
contemplate, in poetic solitude,
the beauty of the objects.</p>

<p class="ph3">"SERMONS."</p>


<div class="image-right" style="width: 226px;">
<a href="images/145bfull.jpg">

<img src="images/145b.jpg" width="226" height="350" alt="untitled" /></a>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read some correspondence on this subject in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i>. Nothing very original. But, Sir, I must ask a
question which I fancy will set clerics and laymen a
thinking. This is it: <i>Why should not a successful
sermon have a good long run?</i></p>

<p>A play that makes a hit runs for weeks, for months,
for years. Audiences come from all parts to hear and
see it. They come, too, by night, a most inconvenient
time, and not by day. Now, why should it not be the
same with a sermon?</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the Rev. Mr. <span class="sc">Silvertrumpet</span>,
of St. Simon's Within-and-Without, preaches a first-rate
sermon. For years past, popular preachers have
been regularly advertised in the newspapers, and
church-goers have been accustomed to look out for
announcements as to where Mr. <span class="sc">Silvertrumpet</span>, or
any other popular preacher, is to appear and discourse.
The actor, on tour, goes round <i>with one play</i> visiting
different towns. <i>Why not the preacher with one
sermon?</i></p>



<p>Perhaps the actor has a <i>répertoire</i> acquired in course
of time: <i>so might it be with the preacher</i>. That a good
sermon, once delivered, should be lost, is as hard on
the preacher as that a good play should be performed
for one night only, and then, "be heard no more!"</p>

<p>My remedial suggestions are: <i>first</i>, let critic attend "first morning"
or "first afternoon" of a new sermon. Let him praise, or
condemn it.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> No critics: but simply an advertisement under a
column headed "Churches," announcing that Mr. <span class="sc">Silvertrumpet</span>
or Mr. <span class="sc">Deskthumper</span>, or whoever it may be, with all his titles,
Canon, Archdeacon, Bishop, Vicar, &amp;c., &amp;c., set out in full, will
preach at such and such a time, at such and such a church. Also,
I think <i>the title of the sermon should be given</i>. There is sometimes
an attraction in a title. Then, that sermon being a success, let it be
thus advertised:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
ST. SIMON'S WITHIN-AND-WITHOUT.&mdash;The
Rev. Mr. <span class="sc">Silvertrumpet's</span> Sermon, entitled
<i>Charity; or, How We Live Now</i>, having achieved
an <span class="sc">Enormous Success</span>, will be repeated <span class="sc">Every Sunday</span>
at 11.30 (<i>or whatever the hour may be</i>) until
further notice.</p>

<p>I maintain that, as there are crowds attracted from
all parts during two years to visit a theatre between
the hours of seven and eleven nightly, in order to see
an amusing or thrilling play, and a popular actor
(likewise twice a week for <i>matinées</i>), so, in like manner,
there would be crowds to come from all parts to hear
a good sermon and see a popular preacher once, or
even twice on Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pitch-ed Out.</span>&mdash;A motion for the introduction of tar-macadam,
instead of granite, as pavement for the Aberdeen streets, was rejected
by the Town Council after a lengthy and lively discussion upon the
subject. What really gave the <i>coup de grâce</i> to the cause of the
Tar-macadamites was a councillor's statement that "he had often
got a wet foot in a tar-macadam street ('<i>Hear, hear!</i>')." This
alarming assertion effectually "queered the pitch"&mdash;to use a slang
expression&mdash;for the would-be innovators, and "granite and dry feet"
won the day by fourteen votes to nine.</p>

<p class="ph3">AS THE LAW SHOULD BE.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>From "The Legal Intelligence" of the Future.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. Justice <i>Punch</i> then addressed the
prisoner in the following words:&mdash;"Prisoner
at the Bar, you have been rightly found guilty
of committing the heinous crime of writing
and causing to be published a pernicious form
of composition known as a 'Penny Dreadful.'
The jury who have tried you have had no
trouble in coming to the conclusion that you
are solely responsible for the fearful results
that have followed the appearance of your
latest contribution to criminal literature. Had
not <i>Red-handed Rob</i> left the printers there is
every reason for believing that the manor-house
would have never been burnt down,
and that poor Mrs. <span class="sc">Smith</span> would have been
still hale and hearty. Nay more, the twenty-seven
burglaries and fifty-six other crimes of
even a yet more serious character would in
all human probabilities have never been committed.
For all this terrible work you are
primarily responsible. In days gone by you
would have escaped the appropriate penalty
of your wickedness. But now that the Pernicious
Story Punishment Act has become
the law of the land, I have the power, as I
have long had the will, to treat you with becoming
severity." His Lordship then passed
sentence in the customary form. Later in
the day the publishers and printers of <i>Red-Handed
Rob</i> were convicted of being accessories
both before and after the fact, and
shared the fate of their colleague in iniquity.</p>

<p>Up in railway; all Switzerland is now "up
in railway." Revisiting simple spot opposite
Jungfrau; here twenty years ago. "Simple!"
Electric light; shops; telescopes;
tourists everywhere! They sprawl
on hillocks like Bank-holiday-Virginia-Waterers!
Just heard
one ask waiter, "'Ow many feet
are we 'ere above the sea?" "One
tousing eight 'undred mètres."
"What's the good of meters?"
What indeed? Electric light
everywhere. Everybody telescoping
chamois, and buying photographs;
photographs chiefly of
<i>other</i> places; all the same when
you return home. Men attired
like golfers; women in gaiters;
exercise, principally shopping.
Simple Switzeresses outside toy-booths,
talk excellent English,
but all in national costume.
N.B. National costume can be
purchased.</p>



<p>There <i>used</i> to be only half an inn here;
there are <i>now</i> five hotels, with a beer-garden,
and inevitable casino. Dancing every
night. Like to watch fair, fat, sentimental
German waltzing solemnly. Elderly Darby of
Albion, too, capering the newest
shuffles and reverses, would surprise
his wife Joan at home.
"Darby is devoted to climbing, and
I was glad to let him return to the
primitive little place I remember
on our honeymoon." That is what
<i>she</i> thinks. <i>Climbing!</i> Not a bit
of it! Most here, when fagged out
with shopping, take guide and porter
up the "Shamhorn." There's a
"Shamhorn" album now wherein
proud mountaineers exhibit flights
of fancy in their records that one
could never guess from their countenances.
At <i>table d'hôte</i> not a
few of <span class="sc">Svengali's</span> opinion, that
"only the dirty want to wash."
But the water is superb! so are
the Alps. Yet am I Oberlanded,
and must go lower to feel higher.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

donkey-chaise people. <i>Special mem. for

<p>Were Ilfracombe a French watering-place, how delightful it could
be made. Imagine the restaurants, the <i>déjeuners à la fourchette</i>,
under cover in bad weather, out in the open air in fine; the good
bands; the casino; the <i>établissement</i>, with excellent reading and
writing-rooms, billiard tables, library, first-rate concerts and fair
dramatic performances; <i>petits chevaux</i>, <i>petits soupers al fresco</i>, and
every possible opportunity afforded for enjoying life <i>en pleine air</i>.

<p><i>À propos</i> of restaurants, there is a splendid chance for starting a
first-rate French hotel in Ilfracombe, with well-devised gardens, and
at such a superb height, that while it would be open to all the most
refreshing breezes&mdash;for it is impossible to feel the full benefit of
these in the valley&mdash;yet would it be warm and cosy during the
coldest months, of which, in an ordinary year with well-regulated
seasons, there cannot be many.</p>

<p>Ilfracombers boast that the snow does not lie in these parts. I
hope the Ilfracombers who gave me this information are, so far,

<p>Of course there are golf links. The links-eye'd golf man looks out
for these at once, and though he has got
to go some little distance for them, there

close at hand. A shilling an hour;

<p>Tenby Pier being in process of construction,
there is no landing except in
small boats, of which there appears to be
a better supply than is usual on such
excursions. But as even these boats cannot be run ashore with their
cargoes, there are the stalwart arms of boatmen extended to carry
ladies, and boatmen's broad shoulders on which gentlemen, unable
to wade, can ride pick-a-back. <i>Anyone over fifteen stone had better
remain on board.</i></p>

<p>A guide-book, written by Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">S. C. Hall</span>&mdash;names held
in grateful remembrance as authorities on Irish legends&mdash;describes
climate of Tenby as being "for the greater portion of the year warm,
dry, and bracing." May be; was not there "for the greater portion
of the year." She "Halls by the Sea," further declare, when comparing
Tenby with Hastings, Ventnor, and Torquay, that it, though
"equally mild, is nevertheless invigorating." Shouldn't have
thought it. But&mdash;very glad to hear it.</p>

<p>Oysters in plenty at Tenby. This being the first month with an

(should he be none the worse afterwards) are heroes made!

<p>In the character of <i>Mr. P.'s</i> Own Inn-spector I venture to pronounce
the Valley of Rocks Hotel at Lynton delightful. Here
everything is unpretentiously English, and even the waiters are not
all foreigners. The supply of certain articles of food may on occasion
run short (which ought not to happen), and consequently you
can only complain of what you <i>don't</i> get, very rarely of what you do.
The other hostelries may be equally good, but of these <i>Mr. P.'s</i> Own
Inn-spector, being un-ubiquitous, cannot speak from experience.</p>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<p>The Valley of Rocks Hotel is so-called because it is <i>not</i> in the
valley but high up, and thence you can go down by the easiest possible
descent, <i>i.e.</i> <i>per</i> water-worked tram-way to Lynmouth, and so
remount. Here we go up up up, and here we go down down down O,
all day at threepence a head per journey, reduction on taking a
quantity of tickets, not persons.</p>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<p>And here comes in my complaint. I do not know what numbers
this "<i>ascenseur</i>" will carry with safety, but that it can <i>not</i> carry
more than twenty, all told, inside and out, with anything like comfort,
I, not being "Your Fat Contributor," will honestly affirm.
Whether the proprietorship is in the hands of a company, or in those
of Sir <span class="sc">Tit Bit Newnes</span> is of no importance. If Sir T. B. N. has the
sole management, he may be trusted in future to look after this
"<i>facilis descensus</i>" well and wisely.</p>

<p>The drivers of the Ilfracombe four-horsed coaches are all good
whips; not showy, but careful. Pretty sight to see <span class="sc">Copp's</span> mail,
the Defiance brought at a trot between the two gate-posts, and tooled
round the small lawn up to the Valley of Rocks Hotel, Lynton.
N.B. Put your name down early for box-seat in Coppy-book.</p>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<p>Notice that the Defiance guard is a master of horn blowing. He
tootles most of the popular tunes of the day with windy wariations,
humourously causing deep bellowing bass notes to issue from the
instrument whenever the coach is passing by a field of cattle. The
guard takes an unfair advantage of these animals, as their peculiarity
being to have no horns, <i>they are unable to return the blow!</i>

<p>It grieves me to be compelled to quit Ilfracombe
just as the real sport is beginning. I do
not allude to the North Devon Stag Hounds, but
to the arrival of September wasps, and very fine
autumn gnats. This morning had a glorious run
over tables and chairs, killing the wily wasp
in the open, that is, on the window pane, with a
slipper. Luckily "<i>pane forte et dure</i>." or there
would have been smashery. Cut off his sting, if possible, with
purpose of presenting it to youngest lady of party. Killed a second,
but less wily wasp. Ran him to earth in jam pot. A third, which
entered by the door, after a rapid burst through the hall, showed
some fine sport, and after getting away in the open (window), went
to ground somewhere in the rose bushes, when the pursuers, armed
with napkins, slippers, and paper-knives, gave up the pursuit, and
returned to breakfast.</p>

<p>Later in the day killed a splendid gnat with very big head and
large wings. Quite a pantomime gnat. Send him<big>:</big> as specimen to
Sir <span class="sc">Augustus Druriolanus</span>. Useful as model for "property gnat"
at Christmas. Or, nailed him to wall, as warning to other gnats.</p>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<p><i>Final Note.</i><big>:</big>&mdash;Ilfracombe ought simply to be perfect. Spare
friendly criticism, and you help to spoil the place. But I say to
the I. I. C., in all friendliness, addressing them in French, "knowing
the language," like <i>Jeames, "Messieurs, j'ai raison, moi; vous,&mdash;vous

<p class="ph3">LETTERS TO A FIANCÉE.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Gladys</span>,&mdash;I am so glad that in spite of your many engagements&mdash;one
of them being an engagement to be married&mdash;you found
time to write to me again at last. You say little about your <i>fiancé</i>,
but that, after all, is of small importance. I approve of engagements
in the abstract; I know of no amusement
more harmless nor more agreeable for a young
girl; and from my own experience I shall be delighted
to assist you, with any little hints in my
power, towards making the course of true love run
as smoothly as possible.</p>

<div class="image-right" style="width: 152px;">
<a href="images/149full.jpg">

<img src="images/149.jpg" width="152" height="350" alt="untitled" /></a>
</div>

<p>You have not described <span class="sc">Arthur</span> very clearly&mdash;(I
am supposing, for the sake of argument, that
his name is <span class="sc">Arthur</span>; in your agitation you did not
tell me his name, but I think you are the sort of girl
who would be in love with the sort of man who
would be called <span class="sc">Arthur</span>)&mdash;you have not, I say, told
me much about him; but from your letter I gather
the following suggestive facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>You were made for each other.</i></p>

<p>A simple and self-evident proposition&mdash;it needs no
comment.</p>

<p>II. <i>He never loved anyone but you! Except
once, many years ago; and he has told you all about it quite
frankly. She was unworthy of him; and married Another.</i></p>

<p>Now I have no doubt whatever, <span class="sc">Gladys</span>, that you are quite
jealous of this person of whom he has told you, quite frankly
and who was unworthy of him, and married Another. I wish I
could convince you of the fact that there is no one in the world so
little dangerous to you as the person to whom he has grown indifferent.
Fear rather the girls he <i>doesn't</i> know, the women he <i>will</i>
meet, the charming people to whom he has just been introduced, the
cousins he has never made love to! The past can not be the rival of
the present: the future may. But this is a subject on which argument
is of no avail. Reason retires, snubbed: and retrospective
sensitiveness remains. Now come his faults:&mdash;</p>

<p>III. <i>He does not like the way you do your hair, and he has a book
of dried flowers with their names written above them in Latin and
violet ink, and he shows them to you when he comes to tea.</i></p>

<p>These appear to be his only defects. I can understand that they
cause you some anxiety, but with care I trust in time they may wear
off. Like <span class="sc">Buffon</span> the naturalist (<i>is</i> it <span class="sc">Buffon</span>?) or somebody, I
have, from stray bones, so to speak, to reconstruct, in imagination,
the entire animal. My impression of him is somewhat vague, but on
the whole satisfactory. It is charming of him to go home and write
to you the instant he has left you&mdash;I think it only right, of course&mdash;when
people meet every day they have a great deal more to write
about than if they saw each other occasionally. One thing in your
letter puzzled me. He has been called to the Bar, but he did not go,
because he had once been thinking of being a clergyman and he had
conscientious scruples about the law. What <i>can</i> you mean? I am
quite at a loss, but since you say it was very noble of him and you
love him all the more, I suppose it is all right. You say his
father has a maddening way of taking you aside and asking
you in general to "use your influence" with <span class="sc">Arthur</span>. He never
says what about, but gives forth irritating platitudes about "a
woman's tact" and "gentle feminine persuasion." You are quite
right to agree at once and not ask for an explanation, as it would
keep you away from <span class="sc">Arthur</span> longer, and it doesn't matter in the
least.</p>

<p>It is very curious about the day <span class="sc">Arthur</span> went shooting and told
you he had shot two brace of grouse, and you found out afterwards
it was not true, he had shot thirteen. You ask me "how you should
act," and say you have as yet "taken no steps in the matter."</p>

<p>Of course, if you find him out in a little fib and let him know it,
he will think you have a horribly suspicious nature and be rather
disgusted at your want of trustfulness; on the other hand, if you
don't show it, he will think you extraordinarily stupid and easily
duped. I think if I were you, I should whenever the subject is
alluded to, pin on an enigmatic smile and be silent. This will be
quite sufficient punishment for the boastfulness of his modesty.
Write soon again. I am glad <span class="sc">Arthur</span> is so good to his sister's
husband. A good brother-in-law always makes an excellent <i>fiancé</i>.</p>

<p>With congratulations and every good wish,</p>


<p class="center">Your affectionate friend,<br />

<p><span class="sc">An Asinine Performance.</span>&mdash;A certain gallant and deservedly
popular colonel, whose love of politics is, perhaps, not quite so
fervent as his fondness for race-horses and greyhounds, has recently
turned his attention to another and comparatively novel form of
sport. This takes the shape of an <i>asinus doctus</i>&mdash;a learned, or accomplished,
donkey&mdash;"who can be matched at jumping, eating, and
drinking, or all three, against any other member of his tribe in the
world," and the erudite animal gave, for the colonel's behoof, a
private exhibition of his attainments in the grounds attached to an
hotel in Norton. First, <i>Ned</i> jumped a 5ft. 6in. bar "without any
apparent effort:" then he devoured an ounce of twist tobacco and
half-a-pound of bacon with equal ease, but the thirst provoked by
the latter comestible had to be assuaged by a quart of champagne
which he "put away" with great promptitude and gusto. Refreshed
with wine he further proceeded to show a clean pair of heels
to a pony in a steeplechase, winning easily&mdash;"ears down" in fact.
Finally, with a fox-terrier dog as his jockey, he galloped round an
orchard. The colonel was much pleased with the entertainment,
and well he might be. There is a brilliant career in store for that
donkey on the variety stage; or even in Parliament, where he might
"command the applause of list'ning senates," while adorning the
Hibernian benches as, of course, Member "for Bray."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mister</span>,&mdash;After to have assisted
at the Congress of Geographs at
London I come of to make a little
<i>voyage d'agrément</i>&mdash;a voyage of agreement&mdash;to
the Island of Wight. I am
gone to render visit to one of my
english friends who inhabits Sandown.
I go not to tell you his name, that
would be to outrage the privacy of
your "Home, sweet home." I shall
call him "<span class="sc">Smith</span>." <i>Ah, le brave
garçon?</i>&mdash;the brave boy! Eh well, this
good <span class="sc">Smith</span> he invites me at him&mdash;<i>chez
lui</i>, how say you?&mdash;and I part
from London by a beautiful morning
of August, and I arrive to Portsmout.
See there the Island of Wight
in face! I traverse the sea in packet-boat,
I arrive to Ride, and, in fine, to
Sandown. <i>Tiens</i>, see there the brave
<span class="sc">Smith</span> on the quay of the station! I
would wish to embrace him. But no!
We are in England. I go to give him
a shake-hands. <i>Voilà tout.</i> And he
conducts me to his house, and I see
there Madame, who is charming, and
his childs. Ah, the dear little childs.
But I speak not of them, because all
that is the "Home, sweet home," and,
as one says in english, the castle of the
Englishman is in his house.</p>

<p>Sandown is a little town, enough
coquette, very well placed at the border
of the sea. In effect, there is a <i>plage</i>,
a <i>promenade</i>, a <i>jetée</i>. It is not precisely
the <i>plage</i> of Trouville, the <i>promenade</i>
of Ostende; but it is enough
agreeable. Only, at place of the
pretty little cabins, the tents, so
charming, so coquette, there is some
drolls of things, some boxes on wheels,
which one calls "bathings machines."
Oh, <i>la, la!</i> I mock myself of them.
And of more! The ladys and the
gentlemans can not to bathe themselves
together. They are there, all
near the one of the other, but not
together. <i>Ah çà, c'est épatant!</i> Me
I march all gaily in the water towards
the ladys; I am in my costume of
bath, all that there is of most as he
must&mdash;<i>de plus comme il faut</i>, how say
you? When a man in a little boat
agitates the arms, and cries himself,
"Hi there!" that is to say, "<i>Hé là-bas!</i>"&mdash;and
still of more which I
comprehend not. And my friend
<span class="sc">Smith</span> he cries to me also, and he
agitates the arms, and, in fine, I comprehend
that it is defended. What
droll of idea!</p>

<p>One day there is the <i>régates</i>&mdash;the
regattas. We go all on the little pier,
and I see the Duckunt, the Watter-polo,
the Greasepol. Ah, it is of the
most amusings! On the promenade
there is the musicians, who play of the
organ, of the banjo; also the singers
that you call "nigers." They are
there all together, and one hears the
valse, the hymn, the song of the Coffee
Concert, all at the time. There is also
a man who walks himself on some stilts.
He is very droll, and the assistance&mdash;<i>l'assistance</i>&mdash;laughs
much. Me I
laugh as the other spectators. The
evening there is a fire of artifice, and
the little town is of the most gay.
There is some "set-pieces," as one calls
them, and I read "Welcome to our
Visitors." That is very polite; I offer
my thanks to Misters the Municipal
Councillors of Sandown. And there is
one other which I see hardly, I see but
"Success to &mdash;&mdash;." My friend <span class="sc">Smith</span>
tells to me that it is "Success to our
Saloon Bar." That may be. But he
is <i>blagueur</i> this <span class="sc">Smith</span>, he pleasants&mdash;<i>plaisante</i>,
how say you?&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p><i>A vrai dire</i>&mdash;to true to say&mdash;Sandown
is well agreeable, above all when
he makes fine. <i>Et il faisait un temps
superbe</i>&mdash;he was making a superb time.
As to the other parts of the Island of
Wight, I go to speak you of them in
one other letter.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Some further Wrinkles by an Amateur Delineator.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
["A hint as to the manner you look at people, when delineating
them for your own purpose, so that they should not be cognisant
you are taking mental notes. Never stare at anyone straight in the
face; and if whilst looking you should catch your subject's eye,
quickly avert your gaze without moving to something about them
that they may be wearing, or to the next person; you may for the
moment appear to be looking into vacancy, or making a mental
calculation, without staring at anything in particular."&mdash;<i>Professor
O., in a weekly journal.</i>]</p></div>


<p>To be a successful delineator you should cultivate the art
of squinting. Do this readily and naturally, without any
apparent effort. This completely baffles the subject, for
even if you catch <i>his</i> eye, you may safely defy him to catch
yours. Beside, it economises time. In a crowd you can
often thus kill two birds with one stone, or stony stare. If,
however, nature has denied you this accomplishment, instead
of squinting, you may wink the other eye. But this is
sometimes misconstrued, as it has a rather challenging
effect. You may find yourself (if the subject is a lady)
head over ears in a flirtation&mdash;or in a somersault down the
stairs&mdash;according to circumstances, before you know where
you are.</p>

<p>Acquire the habit of taking physiognomical snap-shots.
Practise this until, by merely glancing at a person in a good
light for, say the twentieth of a second, you can secure a
mental picture of his or her character, habits, and hobbies.
You can develop and intensify, if necessary, these useful
little views at home, bringing out further details as to the
subject's bank-balance, latest <i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i>, or number of
first-cousins-once-removed. All these points can be elucidated
with a little patience and imagination.</p>

<p>Always, in conversing with a chance acquaintance you
may meet in the street, gaze steadily at the brim of his hat,
or study his necktie with a fixed and critical stare. This
will make him think there is something wrong. He will
fidget, and become nervous, revealing the inmost secrets of
his soul. You then easily bag your instantaneous view,
and depart abruptly with triumph. He will cut you dead
next time, but that doesn't matter. You have added him
to your collection, and can sail in quest of fresh specimens.</p>

<p>Some ladies rather like their new bonnets being examined. Learn,
therefore, to do this with respectful admiration, and be prepared
with an instant and favourable criticism. It is as well to master a
few technical terms, so as to avoid, for example, confusing an
<i>aigrette</i> with a <i>toque</i>.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, your lady victims resent their head-gear
or hair-dye being too closely examined, you must fall back on
mental arithmetic. Calculate how many barleycorns it would take
to go round the equator, or how many white beans there are in five
black ones. If these sums are too hard to be done on the spur of the
moment, work them out at home, and learn the results by heart,
before sallying forth on your head-hunting expeditions.</p>

<p>Never ask a policeman without scanning narrowly his features,
nor, if sitting behind a 'bus-driver, omit to secure his profile. Interview
every crossing-sweeper you pass. Organ-grinders, also, are
fairly inexpensive material to work upon. All these common objects
are readily accessible, and frequently prove perfect mines of character,
if you only dig deep enough below the surface. But the earnest
explorer will find the countenances of cabmen to be the most remunerative
phreno-physiognomical studies. Never mind their remarks if
you can enrich your note-book with some hitherto undiscovered trait
of human nature, with the inner meaning of some mysterious
wrinkle, or with the true poetry of a wayward wart. Return home
happy if the day's achievements include the decipherment of a mole
on a flower-girl's cheek, or the translation of some rare tint of
colour-music on the nose of some loafer near a pub.</p>

<p>Do not be content with the stores of face-reading lore that have
been already acquired. Each day fresh secrets should be revealed. For
instance, it has only recently been ascertained that one freckle on
the tip of the nose means a disposition to borrow money without
returning it; that three pimples in a row across the forehead indicate
unpunctuality and insubordination; or that a droop of the
left eyelid signifies habitual impecuniosity. It is still a moot point
whether a nose can be both Quixotic and witty, and how to read a
promiscuous eyebrow when combined with a constant upper lip.
These, and many other mysteries, are waiting to be laid bare by the
amateur but ardent face delineator.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br />Ladies desirous of "trying their luck" in the matter of marrying
a title, had better turn their attention towards St. Petersburg,
where a French Count has made the novel proposal of starting a
lottery&mdash;with himself as the prize. A million tickets are to be
issued at one rouble each. The winner is to receive, in addition to
an aristocratic husband, the sum of 250,000 roubles; the Count himself
will pocket a quarter of a million; and the remaining half of
the money is to be divided between charity and the promoters of the
"raffle." In the Parisian parlance of the boulevards, this enterprising

<p>I learn from <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> that "Lord <span class="sc">Windsor</span>, who
presided at the Librarians' Congress, is an all-round man. In
addition to his interest in libraries and the support which he has
given to struggling Tory papers, he is a
first-class lawn-tennis player who has
narrowly escaped playing for the amateur
finals, and a cricketer who carries about
with him still the marks of a blow which
he received on the nose in the playing
fields of Eton College." I assume, though
the fact is not expressly stated, that the
blow was inflicted by a cricket ball, and
not by the hostile fist of a fellow Etonian.
It appears, then, that in his early youth
there was about Lord <span class="sc">Windsor's</span> nose a
something, a bridge, an angle, <i>que sçais-je</i>,
which forbad the idea of complete
roundness. The providential arrival of a
sort of hom&oelig;opathic cricket ball removed
the protuberance, and now Lord <span class="sc">Windsor</span>
is <i>totus teres atque rotundus</i>. And, what
is more, he still carries the marks about with him. Gallant President

<p>West Bromwich has my profound sympathy. I read in a
Birmingham paper that "there is a complete deadlock with regard to
the mayoralty of West Bromwich for the coming year. The deputation
appointed at the meeting in August have waited upon several
eligible gentlemen to try and induce them to accept office, but without
any success up to the present. Alderman <span class="sc">Rollason</span> has
declined, and Councillor <span class="sc">Bushell</span> will not undertake the duties, and
the committee are now doing their best to induce Councillor <span class="sc">Slater</span>
to take the position a second time." By this time, let us hope, the
difficulty may have been removed, for imagination boggles at the idea
of a town without a mayor.</p>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>West Bromwich's Committee-men, they fairly tore their hair.
In all West Bromwich's expanse they could not find a Mayor.
Each deputy with anguish notes his prematurely shed lock,
But, dash it, what are men to do confronted by a deadlock?
Each portly Alderman his Aldermanic self excuses,
In vain they try the Councillors, for every one refuses.
Declined with thanks by <span class="sc">Rollason</span>, the honour next they proffer
To <span class="sc">Bushell</span>, who, in turn, declines their most obliging offer.
Next, moving on, they tempt again their ex-Mayor, Mr. <span class="sc">Slater</span>,
"Be thou," they cry, with emphasis, "our mayoral dictator.
With badge and chain and gown of fur it's not a paltry billet;
The breach is ready-made," they say; "step into it and fill it.
A vacuum a nuisance is, we ask thee to abate it;
Our edifice is roofless now, climb up and promptly slate it."</p>
</div>

<p class="lspaced">*  *  *</p>

<p>If Mr. <span class="sc">Slater</span> should ultimately decline the proffered mayoralty,
the only suggestion I can make is that somebody should be
pricked for the office. I don't quite know what it means, but
I know that every year some forty estimable gentlemen are
pricked for the shrievalty of their respective counties. One after
another they arise in the Court of Justice in which this terrible
ceremony takes place and declare that there are circumstances which
absolutely forbid them to accept the post of High Sheriff. One
pleads a reduced rental, another asks to be excused on the ground of
failing health, but the plea is allowed in very few cases, and in the
end most of them are reluctantly pricked. The new cook on board
ship in <span class="sc">Charles Dickens's</span> <i>American Notes</i> was boxed up with the
Captain standing over him, and was forced to roll out pastry which
he protested, being of a highly bilious nature, it was death to him
merely to look at. But he had to roll it out all the same. So it
ought to be with an unwilling candidate for a mayoralty.</p>

<p>Let us be just to our American cousins in spite of boat-racing and
yacht-racing <i>fiascos</i>. There are certain things that they obviously
order much better than we do. For instance, when the silly season
presses they just mark out one of their prominent literary men and
have him attacked by highwaymen. At least this is what lately
happened to Mr. <span class="sc">Richard Harding Davis</span>, for I read in <i>Harper's
Weekly</i> that "a considerable number of daily journals of average
veracity in New York and Boston published accounts of Mr. <span class="sc">Davis's</span>
encounter, differing to such a degree in details that each paper
seemed to derive its information from an independent source. The
very variation of the reports was an indication of a basis to the
original tale: but after all, the despatch which carried most conviction
was one only four lines long, in which Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span> was quoted
as intimating that some industrious writer had lied about him."</p>

<p>Notice again how magnificently they manage an earthquake.
Little more than a week ago a telegram, emanating from Tegucigalpa
in Honduras, was published in the <i>New York Herald</i>. In this it
was stated that "mail advices from Yetapan announced that a
terrible earthquake had occurred in that section of the country."
There were elaborate details. Three hundred persons perished.
Four thousand people from the outlying villages flocked into the city.
During the night "sheets of flame appeared at different points in
the north-west rising to immense heights. A church tower crashed
down, carrying with it the roofs of three houses. Just before daylight
a prolonged shock rocked the entire town as though it were a
cradle, and on the mountain side quantities of grazing cattle were
engulfed by lava. At Covajunca thirty-seven houses were laid in
ruins: at Cayuscat twenty-nine houses collapsed. A later despatch
states that 353 bodies have already been recovered." In short, this
earthquake was carried out in a style of lavish completeness, and
no expense was spared to make it a record convulsion. It is unnecessary
to add that it never happened. There wasn't a single quake in
the whole of Honduras. Like <i>Falstaff's</i> assailants, and like the
highwaymen that waylaid Mr. <span class="sc">Richard Harding Davis</span>, it wore a
suit of buckram. And of all qualities of buckram the American is
unquestionably the best.</p>

<p>It appears, moreover, that <span class="sc">Cain</span> and <span class="sc">Abel</span> lived in Central
America, and that the mausoleum of <span class="sc">Abel</span> is still to be seen in Yucatan,
with all the inscriptions complete. Somehow or other a
migration to Egypt then took place, and the Sphinx was erected by
<span class="sc">Abel's</span> widow as a monument to her murdered husband. All this
has been discovered by M. <span class="sc">le Plongeon</span>; and, to confirm the truth
of the story, Mr. <span class="sc">W. T. Stead</span> is to publish it, bound in buckram,
of course. "<span class="sc">Julia's</span>" share in this discovery is not stated, but there
can be no doubt that she must have been hovering round.</p>

<p>I am told that Cheshire cheese is in a bad way; that the price of it
has fallen so much as to make the total disappearance of Cheshire
cheese extremely likely. At the same time it is said that Cheshire
cheese is going down because the farmers wilfully produce an inferior
article. It may be so, though I hope it is not. But if it is,
why delay the punishment? To produce inferior cheese is as bad as
robbery with violence; and a dozen or so with a Cheshire cat ought
to prove an effective deterrent to the most hardened offender.</p>

<p>(<i>For English Tourists visiting Sebastopol.</i>)

I can assure you that I had no idea of treating Russia with
disrespect.

I was not born at the time of the Crimean War,
and know nothing whatever of the battles of the
Alma, Inkermann, and Balaclava.

I really only require breakfast, and have no intention
of sketching the walls of that fortress.

I was asking the waiter to clean my boots, and not for
information concerning the strength of the garrison.

I was not aware that the place had been declared
a naval port, and was therefore sacred from foreign
invasion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I was not searching for torpedoes,
but only taking a sea bath.</p>

<p>I was as innocent in thought and intention as a
<i>baigneuse</i> at Margate.</p>

<p>I am sorry that it has been necessary to confiscate
my Gladstone bag, as it contains my linen and toilet
requisites.</p>

<p>Certainly my bath sponge is not an explosive.</p>

<p>The programme of <i>Cheer, Boys, Cheer</i>, which is
said to have been found in my bag, is of no political significance.</p>

<p>It certainly was not intended to create a riot at Moscow.</p>

<p>It surely is unnecessary to cover me with chains.</p>

<p>I really must protest against being detained in a dungeon three
feet square, in lieu of occupying a comfortable room in the hotel
<i>au troisième</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to me harsh treatment to deprive me of all my goods and
chattels, and then refuse to allow me to communicate with the
British Ambassador.</p>

<p>Well, of course, if I must go I must, and I suppose I ought to
thank you for securing my ticket.</p>

<p>But surely you have made a mistake. I wished a ticket for
Hampstead.</p>

<p>Very sorry that you should tell me that <i>you</i> are right&mdash;&mdash;from this
I gather I am booked (without appeal) to Siberia!</p>
